This is an example of position. The marks are ordered in a line chronollogically. The line moves up or down depending on the reported cases by day. The marks are selectable based on their position in relation to each toher. They are associative because they connect to form a line. The quantittative aspect comes from the y-axis denoting reported cases by day. The length extends across the x-axis representing time from February 2020 to the begining of January.

These values are selective because they rely on the data of the location on a map. They are not associative to eachother or ordered because of their nature on the map.
