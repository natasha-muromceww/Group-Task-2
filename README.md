## Position

This is an example of position. The marks are ordered in a line chronollogically. The line moves up or down depending on the reported cases by day. The marks are selectable based on their position in relation to each toher. They are associative because they connect to form a line. The quantittative aspect comes from the y-axis denoting reported cases by day. The length extends across the x-axis representing time from February 2020 to the begining of January.

## Size

This chart compares the percent of population vaccintaed across ages and one dose versus full vaccination. The placement of the bars is selective and ordered in relation to eachother in terms of age group of vaccination doses. The size of the bars indicates a percent value.

This is a value map of vaccination rates per county. As per the key, the darker values have a higher percentage of the population vaccincated and vice versa. These values are selective because they rely on the data of the location on a map. They are not associative to eachother or ordered because of their nature on the map.

This is a map of the United States with each county colored depending on the amount of covid deaths per capita in the first week of January. The dark red counties represent the highest amount of deaths and the orange and yellow colors represent lower amounts of covid deaths per capita. There representation does show quantitative values directly on the image, the order is in relation to it's category, and the length is consistent with each arrow.

## Orientation

This is a chart tracking covid cases, deaths, and hospitalizations. the orientation of the arrows point upwards depending on how much of an increase there was in the past 14 days.
